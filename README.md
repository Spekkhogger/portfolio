# Portfolio

This website is my personal portfolio and resume. 

## Description
A school project to create a personal portfolio. This website consists of two pages. The first page contains links that will take you further down the page to three sections. These section are: 
- Projects
- About me
- Contact

I have now also added a page for colorthemes. I love colors, and I wanted to include this personal page with some of my favorite color combinations.

The website and URL are hosted on Netlify.com
